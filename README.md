Terraform module for multi-AZ [`subnets`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) provisioning.

The module creates private and public subnets in the provided Availability Zones.

The public subnets are routed to the Internet Gateway specified by `var.igw_id`.

`nat_gateway_enabled` flag controls the creation of NAT Gateways in the public subnets.

The private subnets are routed to the NAT Gateways provided in the `var.az_ngw_ids` map.

## Usage



```hcl
locals {
  public_cidr_block  = cidrsubnet(var.cidr_block, 1, 0)
  private_cidr_block = cidrsubnet(var.cidr_block, 1, 1)
}

module "vpc" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = var.namespace
  stage      = var.stage
  name       = var.name
  cidr_block = var.cidr_block
}

module "public_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = var.namespace
  stage               = var.stage
  name                = var.name
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-2a", "us-east-2b", "us-east-2c"]
  vpc_id              = module.vpc.vpc_id
  cidr_block          = local.public_cidr_block
  type                = "public"
  igw_id              = module.vpc.igw_id
  nat_gateway_enabled = "true"
}

module "private_subnets" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace          = var.namespace
  stage              = var.stage
  name               = var.name
  availability_zones = ["us-east-2a", "us-east-2b", "us-east-2c"]
  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  cidr_block         = local.private_cidr_block
  type               = "private"

  az_ngw_ids = module.public_subnets.az_ngw_ids
}
```




## Examples

Given the following configuration

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = var.namespace
  name       = "vpc"
  stage      = var.stage
  cidr_block = var.cidr_block
}

locals {
  public_cidr_block  = cidrsubnet(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 1, 0)
  private_cidr_block = cidrsubnet(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 1, 1)
}

module "public_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = var.namespace
  stage               = var.stage
  name                = var.name
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-2a", "us-east-2b", "us-east-2c"]
  vpc_id              = module.vpc.vpc_id
  cidr_block          = local.public_cidr_block
  type                = "public"
  igw_id              = module.vpc.igw_id
  nat_gateway_enabled = "true"
}

module "private_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = var.namespace
  stage               = var.stage
  name                = var.name
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-2a", "us-east-2b", "us-east-2c"]
  vpc_id              = module.vpc.vpc_id
  cidr_block          = local.private_cidr_block
  type                = "private"
  az_ngw_ids          = module.public_subnets.az_ngw_ids
}

output "private_az_subnet_ids" {
  value = module.private_subnets.az_subnet_ids
}

output "public_az_subnet_ids" {
  value = module.public_subnets.az_subnet_ids
}
```

the output Maps of AZ names to subnet IDs look like these

```hcl
public_az_subnet_ids = {
  us-east-2a = subnet-ea58d78e
  us-east-2b = subnet-556ee131
  us-east-2c = subnet-6f54db0b
}
private_az_subnet_ids = {
  us-east-2a = subnet-376de253
  us-east-2b = subnet-9e53dcfa
  us-east-2c = subnet-a86fe0cc
}
```

and the created subnet IDs could be found by the AZ names using `map["key"]` or [`lookup(map, key, [default])`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html#lookup-map-key-default-),

for example:

`public_az_subnet_ids["us-east-2a"]`

`lookup(private_az_subnet_ids, "us-east-2b")`
