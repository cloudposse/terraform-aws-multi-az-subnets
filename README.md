# terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module for multi-AZ [`subnets`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) provisioning.

The module creates private and public subnets in the provided Availability Zones.

The public subnets are routed to the Internet Gateway specified by `var.igw_id`.

`nat_gateway_enabled` flag controls the creation of NAT Gateways in the public subnets.

The private subnets are routed to the NAT Gateways provided in the `var.az_ngw_ids` map.

*Example of `terraform apply` outputs*



## Usage

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "${var.namespace}"
  name       = "vpc"
  stage      = "${var.stage}"
  cidr_block = "${var.cidr_block}"
}

locals {
  public_cidr_block  = "${cidrsubnet(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 1, 0)}"
  private_cidr_block = "${cidrsubnet(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 1, 1)}"
}

module "public_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = "${var.namespace}"
  stage               = "${var.stage}"
  name                = "${var.name}"
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  vpc_id              = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  cidr_block          = "${local.public_cidr_block}"
  type                = "public"
  igw_id              = "${module.vpc.igw_id}"
  nat_gateway_enabled = "true"
}

module "private_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = "${var.namespace}"
  stage               = "${var.stage}"
  name                = "${var.name}"
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  vpc_id              = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  cidr_block          = "${local.private_cidr_block}"
  type                = "private"

  # Map of AZ names to NAT Gateway IDs that was created in "public_subnets" module
  az_ngw_ids          = "${module.public_subnets.az_ngw_ids}"

  # Need to explicitly provide the count since Terraform currently can't use dynamic count on computed resources from different modules
  # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/10857
  # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12125
  # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/4149
  az_ngw_count = 3
}
```




## Examples

Given the following configuration

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "${var.namespace}"
  name       = "vpc"
  stage      = "${var.stage}"
  cidr_block = "${var.cidr_block}"
}

locals {
  public_cidr_block  = "${cidrsubnet(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 1, 0)}"
  private_cidr_block = "${cidrsubnet(module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, 1, 1)}"
}

module "public_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = "${var.namespace}"
  stage               = "${var.stage}"
  name                = "${var.name}"
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  vpc_id              = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  cidr_block          = "${local.public_cidr_block}"
  type                = "public"
  igw_id              = "${module.vpc.igw_id}"
  nat_gateway_enabled = "true"
}

module "private_subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-multi-az-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = "${var.namespace}"
  stage               = "${var.stage}"
  name                = "${var.name}"
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  vpc_id              = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  cidr_block          = "${local.private_cidr_block}"
  type                = "private"
  az_ngw_ids          = "${module.public_subnets.az_ngw_ids}"
  az_ngw_count        = 3
}

output "private_az_subnet_ids" {
  value = "${module.private_subnets.az_subnet_ids}"
}

output "public_az_subnet_ids" {
  value = "${module.public_subnets.az_subnet_ids}"
}
```

the output Maps of AZ names to subnet IDs look like these

```hcl
public_az_subnet_ids = {
  us-east-1a = subnet-ea58d78e
  us-east-1b = subnet-556ee131
  us-east-1c = subnet-6f54db0b
}
private_az_subnet_ids = {
  us-east-1a = subnet-376de253
  us-east-1b = subnet-9e53dcfa
  us-east-1c = subnet-a86fe0cc
}
```

and the created subnet IDs could be found by the AZ names using `map["key"]` or [`lookup(map, key, [default])`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html#lookup-map-key-default-),

for example:

`public_az_subnet_ids["us-east-1a"]`

`lookup(private_az_subnet_ids, "us-east-1b")`
